    <h3 class="question"> What did I do this summer? </h3>

    <p class="answer"> I just moved into an aprtment in preparation to attend ASU in the fall!
      I'm excited to be living on my own and I'm looking forward to the new
      opportunities it will bring. I got all of the furniture I needed for free
      from various people who didn't want it anymore. </p>

    <h3 class="question"> What does the rest of my summer look like? </h3>

    <p class="answer"> After DCSI, I am going to start working and saving up money to help pay
      for food, rent, and school. I am also going camping with my girlfriend's
      family for 4th of July, and might take a road trip to San Diego! </p>
