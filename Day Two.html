    <h1> Day Two </h1>

    <h2> Tuesday, June 13th, 2017 </h2>

    <p class="dayTwo"> Yesterday was the first day of classes. In Web Design, we learned how to
    create a basic html document. In Digital Sound, we played around in Audacity.
  In 3D Modeling, we started designing a headstock for a banjo in Autodesk
  Fusion 360. </p>
