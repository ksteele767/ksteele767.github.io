    <h1>Day Three</h1>
    <h2>Wednesday, June 14th, 2017</h2>

    <p class="dayThree">On Tuesday, most of my classes expanded on the topics discussed on Monday.
    In Web Desgin, we learned how to add color and style to our web pages,
    giving them a better physical appearance. In Digital Sound, we wwent for a
    walk around ASU campus and recorded a plethora of sounds using Zoom field
    recorders. In 3D Modeling, we installed the frets on the fretboard of our
    banjos and finished up the design of the headstock and soundboard.</p>
